# Ballistic Mass Transfer Necessarily Contracts Orbits in Binary Star Systems

In mass-transferring binary star systems, classical theories show orbital expansion when $q = M_{\mathrm{donor}}/M_{\mathrm{accretor}} < 1$. However, these predictions rely on angular momentum conservation. I show that a ballistic prescription, where transferred mass $\delta m$ carries the donor's instantaneous velocity, exhibits linear momentum conservation but implies a systematic loss of \textit{orbital} angular momentum corresponding to an effective external torque. Specifically, the fractional loss of orbital angular momentum yields $L_f/L_i = 1 - f$, i.e., fractional angular momentum loss equals fractional mass transferred.
